Sharp MZ-80K programs (.mzf format)

As of January 30th 2021, the following have been archived here:

BASIC SP-5025

1. A prime number generator, using the sieve of Erastothenes algorithm.
2. An implementation of Computing Today's "The Valley" game, published April 1982.

Sharp MZ-80K emulators (such as the EmuZ-80K - http://takeda-toshiya.my.coocan.jp/mz80k/index.html) will work
directly with the .mzf files stored here. 

If you are fortunate enough to have access to the real thing with a tape deck, mzf files need to be converted into
an audio file (.wav) first. MZFStudio - https://www.nachthacker.de/DownloadBereich.html - is excellent for this
conversion (and will also convert .wav files into .mzf format).
